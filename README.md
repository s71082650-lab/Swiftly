  Climate change is accelerating, bringing heatwaves, extreme weather, and rising sea levels closer to home. AI ClimateGuard tackles this crisis by combining real-time environmental monitoring, predictive analytics, and personalized sustainability advice, helping individuals, businesses, and cities act in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. This project bridges the gap between climate science and practical action.

Problem Statement:
Global warming remains one of the most pressing challenges of our time, driven by rising greenhouse gas emissions that cause severe heatwaves, extreme weather events, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and food and water insecurity. Despite international commitments such as the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, progress has been slow. A major obstacle is the lack of accessible, real-time tools for measuring and reducing carbon footprints at both individual and institutional levels.

Proposed Solution:
AI ClimateGuard is an intelligent platform designed to monitor, predict, and reduce environmental impact through real-time data analysis. The system collects data from IoT sensors, satellite imagery, and meteorological reports to create a live map of carbon emissions, energy consumption, and potential climate risks. It generates actionable strategies for cities, businesses, and individuals, guiding them toward greener practices in line with the Paris Agreement targets.

How AI is Utilized
Data Analysis: Processes vast datasets from diverse sources to detect trends in emissions and environmental change.
Predictive Modelling: Uses machine learning to forecast temperature changes, precipitation patterns, and the likelihood of climate-related disasters.
Optimization: Suggests cost-effective, eco-friendly measures to reduce emissions, increase renewable energy adoption, and improve sustainability efforts.
Personalized Impact Tracking: Calculates individual and corporate carbon footprints and provides tailored recommendations for reduction.

Impact
By integrating advanced AI capabilities with global climate goals, AI ClimateGuard empowers users to take measurable actions against global warming. It bridges the gap between climate science and everyday decision-making, accelerating the path toward achieving the Paris Climate Agreement’s objectives.
